user account will broadcast a transaction containing
  - program hash to run
  - data hash to operate on
  - maximum fee they will pay
    - this becomes locked on the network
  - threshold of computers that must agree

nodes participating in the network may
  - choose to accept the workload
    - choose to accept the program
    - choose to accept the data
  - they may set a maximum runtime
  - they may set a resource limit
  - the first threshold of nodes to complete the workload with the same result split the users fee
  - the computers must encrypt the data with a key derived by the network, not available to the user, then post it
  - once they are all paid, the decryption key is revealed to the user
